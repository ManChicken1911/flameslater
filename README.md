`flameslater` is a utility for Autodesk Flame for people who do lots of spot versioning.
It turns .csv files into Flame Text setups (.ttg files) using your own .ttg as a template.

It can also call `xclip` on Linux to place spot codes on the clipboard, allowing you to
easily rename your sequences in Flame using something like Klipper.
